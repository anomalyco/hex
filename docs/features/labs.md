# Labs

Labs holds features we're unsure about, **especially features people asked
for that we built**: they land in Labs, off by default, instead of shipping
on. There is no master switch. **Labs** is always the last item in the
sidebar and lists every Labs feature as one flat row (name, one-line
description, toggle), each **off by default**, plus Send feedback and Run
setup again.

```ts

```

Settings saved before this model may carry `labs.enabled`; it is read and
ignored, and every feature keeps its own toggle. `hex status` lists the
features on (`Labs` line on macOS, `labs` array in the macOS and Linux JSON,
`labs\t…` on Windows).

Every toggle applies at once, from the window or `hex labs on|off` (issue
568, from @maharshi365): Live text is asked as each dictation starts and its
plate is always installed (prewarmed only when Live text is on at launch);
the window always attaches the playground with Rune's own ⇧⌘D off, and its
sidebar item, ⇧⌘D, the macOS View menu, and story links open it only while
the toggle is on. Live chapters are read when a recording starts. Nothing
starts at launch for a feature that is off. Limit: the macOS window's fixed
size is chosen when it is created, so it becomes resizable for the
playground only after Hex restarts.

Gate a Labs feature where its work starts (the worker, thread, or capture),
not only where its UI appears: `labs::live_text()`, `labs::live_chapters()`,
`labs::playground()`, `labs::vocabulary_biasing()`,
`app_settings::meetings_enabled()`, or `app_settings::hex_microphone_enabled()`.
Add a new feature to `labs::Feature` (name, settings key, description), give
it a row in `rune_ui/labs.rs` and a `hex settings` key, and default it off.
When a feature graduates, remove it from Labs.

Mouse shortcuts off: the recorder ignores mouse buttons, `hex settings`
refuses one, and a saved mouse-button shortcut goes back to its default when
settings load (macOS), with a one-time note in General
(`mouse_shortcut_notice`). Check:
`mouse_shortcuts_go_back_to_their_default_while_their_labs_toggle_is_off` in
[app_settings.rs](../../src/app_settings.rs).

Normal features, not Labs: dictation, Annotate (every build; its own pane
and switch), lowering audio while dictating (#210), Dot scope, chord shortcuts, QuickJS transformations, clipboard
restore, the vocabulary list itself (rewriting and search), and Linux's
Terminal paste.

## Features

- Live chapters: chapter a meeting's transcript live while it records
  (macOS, Apple Intelligence; see
  [Live Chapters](meetings.md#live-chapters-labs)). Its own switch is
  `labs.live_chapters` (off by default). The gate,
  `labs::live_chapters()`, is where the work starts: the recorder's chapter worker, recording
  chapters in the manifest, and the boundary pass after Stop.
- New onboarding (no toggle; it runs only when invoked): the onboarding
  story, replayed on every OS
  (`rune_ui/onboarding_kit/live.rs`): the real model download, Microphone and
  Accessibility rows that follow macOS (ready at once on Linux and Windows,
  which ask for no permissions), and a practice dictation with the real
  shortcut and the HUD on the live microphone level. The window's tour stays
  the state machine underneath. Labs' **Run setup again** and
  `hex onboarding reset` (macOS control socket, the Linux service socket,
  and a named event on Windows) forget that onboarding finished
  (`onboarding::reset_at`) and replay the first run without touching
  settings, history, models, or permissions; ready steps pass at once. A new
  install still gets the tour as its first run. Checks:
  `labs_run_setup_again_opens_the_first_run` and
  `run_setup_again_opens_the_first_run_on_linux_and_windows` in
  [panes.rs](../../src/rune_ui/tests/panes.rs). Every OS reads the practice
  dictation from the listener's event log (`rune_ui/practice.rs`). Not yet:
  words flying into the field.
- Live text: a streaming dictation shows what you have said so far while
  you dictate, as one click-through line just past the recording HUD (every
  OS; see [Streaming Finish](dictation.md#streaming-finish)). Its toggle
  is `labs.live_text` (off by default), asked as each dictation starts. The
  gate, `labs::live_text()`, is where the work starts: with it off, the engine gives a hotkey capture's
  live stream no partial slot and never reads the model's text between
  feeds, and no host adds the line's overlay. Each dictation's `finished
  live stream` line in process.log counts its text changes (`partials`);
  `RUST_LOG=hex=debug` adds a `live text` line per change with the audio
  fed and the word counts, never the words. Checks:
  `a_dictation_stream_publishes_its_text_after_each_feed_with_live_text`,
  `without_live_text_a_dictation_stream_publishes_nothing`,
  `each_dictation_stream_has_its_own_text`, and
  `a_failed_feed_clears_the_text_and_stops_publishing` in
  [transcription_engine.rs](../../src/transcription_engine.rs);
  `live_text_follows_the_recording_and_never_outlives_it` in
  [dictation.rs](../../src/dictation.rs); the three tests in
  [live_text.rs](../../src/live_text.rs) (a recording's end clears only its
  own text); `a_spot_places_the_plate_just_past_the_hud`,
  `a_short_line_hugs_its_words_in_the_middle`,
  `a_long_line_stays_inside_the_overlay_on_one_line`, and
  `no_words_draw_nothing` in
  [rune_ui/live_text.rs](../../src/rune_ui/live_text.rs), whose opt-in
  `snapshots` renders the line in light and dark; and
  `live_text_hangs_just_past_the_plate_wherever_it_sits` in
  [hud_placement.rs](../../src/hud_placement.rs). The line has no golden
  and no `--snap` scene (overlays have none), and nothing headless checks
  how it appears and hides on screen.
- Playground: Rune's playground in the window (every OS), `labs.playground`
  (off by default, applied at once). While on, a **Playground** sidebar item,
  ⇧⌘D (View › Playground on macOS), or Ctrl+Shift+D swaps the window for a list of
  folded groups, nested by path:

  ```ts
  Prototypes        stories that aren't the window
  ├── Onboarding    the options and First run
  ├── Meetings      Live notes: a canned call's chapters and notes under a
  │                 draggable capsule, hidable, copied whole, new, or by
  │                 chapter (nothing real runs; live_notes.rs)
  ├── HUD           (macOS) each placement × look × ending, Processing, Your voice + live HUD Lab Dot scope sliders & Save
  └── Capture capsule   (macOS) whole flow and each state × flow, notch, family
  Window            every macOS-window fixture scene by pane, under a readable name
  ├── General       Settings, Microphone missing, Shortcut/…, Updates/…
  ├── Output, Modes … HUD Lab, Activity, Transcription model, Shortcut explainer, Onboarding tour
  Linux & Windows   the portal and Windows fixtures
  ```

  Every group starts folded; opening a story, from the list or a link,
  unfolds the groups above it, and folds hold until Hex quits. The list
  keeps only its own keys (arrows, Return, J/K, a story's trigger letters,
  Tab, Esc, `/` to filter) and ⇧⌘D; every other key, ⌘-chords and digits
  included, reaches the open story. Each
  story starts from a fresh fixture; the real window keeps running
  underneath. With it on at launch, the macOS window resizes, so the stage
  beside the playground's columns has room. Off, no shortcut, menu item,
  sidebar item, or link opens it.
  Headless renders take `--playground [story]` while it is on, e.g.
  `hex app -- --snap out.png --playground "Window/General/Settings"`. Checks: `every_scene_but_live_has_a_path_under_a_group`,
  `the_playgrounds_keys_work_with_a_story_open`, and
  `a_scene_opened_from_the_list_hears_command_digits` in
  [playground.rs](../../src/rune_ui/playground.rs).
  First run's side controls tune rise, leave, travel, stagger and keyboard
  arrival; Quick motion and Gentle motion are presets. The real first run
  uses the default values from
  [landing.rs](../../src/rune_ui/onboarding_kit/landing.rs): zero-bounce
  vertical entrances/exits, with each stagger delaying the whole entrance.
  The demonstration's second send removes its input field in the same layout
  change, so the card contracts once while the old field fades inside it.
  Polling follows the display clock; the scripted HUD samples between 60 Hz
  frames, the download HUD advances one retained simulation, and the microphone
  bars follow the level continuously. A real press keeps the waiting HUD open;
  completion collapses it until another press. The compositor draws a waveform
  per effect slot, retaining an outgoing page's waveform through its fade. The
  `the_hud_advances_between_sixty_hertz_frames` regression checks different
  half-frame poses, and
  `pressing_keeps_the_waiting_hud_open_and_completion_stays_gone` checks the live
  HUD on a virtual clock. A headless story recording does not prove native display
  pacing or a real permission grant.
  On macOS a story opens from a link or the CLI:

  ```ts
  open 'hex://story/prototypes/hud/notch?variant=pulse-fail&play=1'   // hex-test:// in Hex Test.app
  open 'hex://story/prototypes/capture-capsule/suggestions?variant=toast'
  hex window story Prototypes/HUD/Processing [--variant 2] [--play]
  ├── the window opens on the story: its path, name, or slug, `/` or `-` between groups and name
  ├── a link from before the groups nested (`hud/processing`, `General/mac-settings`, `mac-settings`) → that story now
  ├── variant=<n|name> → that variant
  ├── play=1 → its `r` trigger runs, as pressing R does
  ├── playground off → only the window opens; process.log says why, the CLI answers feature-off
  └── another link, or longer than 2 KiB → ignored and logged
  ```

  An unknown story opens the list and an unknown variant the story; Rune
  logs which to stderr. Checks: `reads_story_links`, `links_from_before_the_list_nested_still_open_their_story`, `ignores_other_links`
  in [story_link.rs](../../src/rune_ui/story_link.rs);
  `every_hud_story_and_variant_opens_from_its_link` and
  `every_capsule_story_and_flow_opens_from_its_link` in
  playground.rs open every HUD and capsule link headlessly. The URL
  handler and the replay have no automated end-to-end check.
- Voice Filter: the Voice Filter pane (macOS and Linux), the only home of
  the Hex Microphone (macOS's driver, Linux's PipeWire virtual source), its
  filter modes, and Try it
  ([Hex Microphone](README.md#experimental-hex-microphone-and-voice-filter)).
  Its toggle is `experimental.hex_microphone` (off by default). Off, the pane
  is hidden and Hex neither reads the driver's status nor starts its sink
  supervisor. While the driver is installed the Voice Filter runs (apps using
  the Hex Microphone keep their audio), its pane shows, and its Labs row is
  on and disabled: "On while the Hex Microphone driver is installed.
  Uninstall the driver in Voice Filter to turn it off." Checks:
  `voice_filter_shows_only_while_its_labs_toggle_is_on` and
  `an_installed_driver_keeps_the_voice_filter_on` in
  [panes.rs](../../src/rune_ui/tests/panes.rs);
  `the_setting_or_an_installed_driver_turns_the_voice_filter_on_and_labs_never_does`
  in [app_settings.rs](../../src/app_settings.rs).
- Meetings (beta): see [Meetings](meetings.md). Its toggle is
  `meetings.enabled`; on, Meetings is a top-level sidebar item (debug builds
  keep it available regardless).
- Vocabulary biasing: Parakeet transcription biased toward the
  [vocabulary](vocabulary.md) (`transcribe_cpp::RunExtension::ParakeetVocabulary`),
  the request behind issue 452 / PR 457. Off (the default),
  `vocabulary::transcription_bias` returns nothing, so no run or stream takes
  the list; rewriting and search still use it, and the Vocabulary sheet says
  so.
- Terminal paste (Windows): paste with Ctrl+Shift+V instead of Ctrl+V for
  apps that ignore a synthetic Ctrl+V (issue 477 / PR 478). Its toggle is the
  shared `paste_with_shift`; Linux keeps it as a General › Advanced row.
